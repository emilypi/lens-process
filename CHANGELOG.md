# Revision history for lens-process

## 0.4.0.0

**Administrative:**

 - Migration to Gitlab CI
 - Support for 8.10
 - Migrate to using `cabal-doscpec` instead of docspec custom setup

**API changes:**

 - Enum prisms are now `Prism a ()` instead of `Prism a a` for `StdStream`.
 - Prisms prefixed with `Is` are now prefixed with `As` in alignment with lens convention.

## 0.3.0.1

- Support for 8.8.1

## 0.3.0.0

Final design - this will not change unless `System.Process` significantly changes.

- `System.Process.Lens.CommandSpec` is renamed to `System.Process.Lens.CmdSpec` to be more flush with the data names
- documentation improvements all around
- Type signatures of combinators `inheriting`, `piping`, `handling` and `nostreaming` have had their unnecessary constraints dropped
- `microlens-process` is now in lockstep featurewise

## 0.2.0.0

The module formerly known as `Internal.hs` is now called `ProcessHandler.hs`

the `CreateProcess` optics have changed to avoid name clashes with `System.IO (stdin, stderr, stdout)`,
instead opting for the post-fixed underscore.

Added doctest suite.
